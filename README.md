-health-check.ssh: you can run this on any server to get system health details printed.
-multiple-node-health-check.ssh: you can add multiple server names from your ssh config in servers array and then run it to get health details of all listed servers.In order to run this script,
you must have health-check.ssh in the same folder as of this file.
